**I am currently a Graduate student in the Department of Chemistry at University of California, Irvine, USA.**


**I work on Theoretical Chemistry, a field that promises to give insights into Chemistry, Biology and Material Science using Physics and Mathematics. I am interested in developing new mathematical and computational methods which will help us to get a deeper understanding of molecules and give better predicting power.** 

**Apart from my research I am enthusiastic about traveling, photography and food!**
